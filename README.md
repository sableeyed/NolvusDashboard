# Welcome

This product is for Linux only. If you are looking for the Windows version it is [here](https://github.com/vektor9999/NolvusDashboard)

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/sableeyed/NolvusDashboard/wiki) for more detailed information

# Bugs / Info
Nexus Premium IS required at this time. There are plans to allow free users in the future.

For more information on known issues please see [this](https://github.com/sableeyed/NolvusDashboard/wiki/Bugs) wiki section

Lastly, if you are not willing to read and solve errors, this is not for you. Installing Nolvus should be as simple as it is on Windows, but getting it running will require some work.

# Wine
A wine prefix will be created for you in `~/.local/share/NolvusDashboard/prefix`.

Do not modify this unless you know what you are doing.

If you break the prefix you can delete the folder and relaunch the Dashboard to have it create a new one.

This prefix is required to run certain tools like BSArch, or manage MO2 without the use of Steam.

# Required Software
- Protontricks
- Winetricks
- Wine
- .NET Runtime 9.0
- xrandr
- xorg-xwayland (if using a wayland compositor)
