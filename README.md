# Wine
A wine prefix will be created for you in `~/.local/share/NolvusDashboard/prefix`.

Do not modify this unless you know what you are doing.

If you break the prefix you can delete the folder and relaunch the Dashboard to have it create a new one.

This prefix is required to run certain tools like BSArch, or manage MO2 without the use of Steam.

# Required Software

- Winetricks
- Wine
- xdelta3
- .NET Runtime 9.0
