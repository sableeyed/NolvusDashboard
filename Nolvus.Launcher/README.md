# Nolvus Launcher

a small program designed to trick steam into launching an executable. Place a file called "instancepath.txt" in your skyrim directory alongside this file. Make sure it is named SkyrimSELauncher.exe

instancepath.txt should have a linux path to MO2: /full/path/to/Nolvus/MO2/ModOrganizer.exe

inspired by https://github.com/Furglitch/modorganizer2-linux-installer/tree/master/steam-redirector
